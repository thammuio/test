# Streamlit as a CML Application

![The Streamlit logo](docs/images/streamlit-logo.png)

A minimal example of a [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) application running as a CML or CDSW Application.
We display and chart a small dataset with Seaborn.

## Repository Structure

```bash
.

├── .project-metadata.yaml  # Declarative specification of this project
├── app.py                  # The Streamlit app script.

## Launching the project on CML

There are three ways to launch this project on CML:

1. **From Prototype Catalog** - Navigate to the Prototype Catalog on a CML workspace, select the "Streamlit" tile, click "Launch as Project", click "Configure Project"
2. **As ML Prototype** - In a CML workspace, click "New Project", add a Project Name, select "ML Prototype" as the Initial Setup option, copy in the repo URL, click "Create Project", click "Configure Project"
3. **Manual Setup** - In a CML workspace, click "New Project", add a Project Name, select "Git" as the Initial Setup option, copy in the repo URL, click "Create Project". Launch a Python 3 Workbench Session and run `!pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install requirements. Then create a CML Application as described in the [CML documentation](https://docs.cloudera.com/machine-learning/1.1/applications/topics/ml-applications.html), using `cdsw/launch_app.py` as the script.

## Using the app

Once the CML Application has been created (by any means), you can launch it from the Applications pane.
This should open a browser window, with a Streamlit application running at a URL
similar to `streamlit.cdsw.your-organisation.com`.

If everything worked, you should see an application like this:

To develop the Streamlit app, open a Python 3 workbench session and modify `app.py`.
